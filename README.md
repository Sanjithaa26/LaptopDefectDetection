This project is an end-to-end web application that leverages deep learning and computer vision to automatically detect defects in laptop images. Users can upload individual images or entire folders of laptop photos, select from three models (ResNet-50, YOLOv8, MobileNetV2) and receive instant predictions about the presence and type of defects. The backend is powered by trained neural networks, while the frontend provides an intuitive interface for uploading, processing and visualizing results, including annotated images and confidence scores. This tool streamlines quality control for laptop hardware by enabling fast, automated and accurate defect identification.
